### Parallel Processing Simulation
- The first solution is multithreaded merge sort with shared memory between the threads and multi process merge sort to show the difference 
- The other two problems are two different types of real world problems are modelled as a computer program with parallel processing using careful use of threads, mutexes, semaphores and conditional variables.
- More details for each solution is mentioned in the README.md in the associated solution
